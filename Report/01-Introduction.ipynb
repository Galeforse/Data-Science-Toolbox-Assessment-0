    "The project guidance initially took us towards [Secrepo - source of security data](http://www.secrepo.com/). After this we looked to other sources of cybersecurity data to see what other examples of this type of data we could obtain and analyse. We also looked at sources of code and analysis that had been performed on data. This took us to sources such as: \n",
    "* [The UNSW-NB15 Dataset](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/)\n",
    "* [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)\n",
    "* [Malware Capture Facility Project](https://mcfp.weebly.com/mcfp-dataset.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed those of us who had little prior experience of working with cybersecuriy data to gain a good exposure to the kinds of analysis we could do on this kind of data such as Machine Learning, Traffic Analysis and visualisation processes. \n",
